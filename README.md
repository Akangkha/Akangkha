## 👋 About Me

I’m **Akangkha**, a software engineer who enjoys working at the intersection of:

* **Distributed systems & cloud-native architectures**
* **Full-stack product development** with real users and real constraints
* **Clean design & thoughtful developer experience**

I like problems that are a little too hard, systems that need to be tamed, and products that deserve more care than a quick prototype. My work is guided by three principles:

* **Clarity over chaos** – simple, observable, well-documented systems
* **Reliability over theatrics** – uptime and correctness before cleverness
* **Respect for the user** – performance, accessibility, and flow matter

## 🧩 How I Work

* I think in **end-to-end flows** – from client interaction to database, infra, and monitoring.
* I care about **API design, data modeling, and failure modes** as much as UI polish.
* I’m comfortable moving between **deep focus work** and **leading teams & discussions**.
* I document decisions, not just code.

If you’re looking for someone who can both **architect** and **execute**, while staying grounded and collaborative – that’s where I’m happiest.

* **Calm under pressure** – outages, migrations, and deadlines don’t scare me; they focus me.
* **Communication** – I explain tradeoffs, not just solutions.
* **Range** – from CLI tools & backend services to dashboards, UX flows, and developer tooling.
